# one button = one game

hi. I'm scout. I'm very dedicated to twitter jokes and I will make you a shitty twine game if you give me a button.

* for jason: [the worst escape room](worst-escape-room.html)
* for laura: [bus adventure FULL VERSION](bus-adventure.html)
* for erin: [waiting room](waiting-room.html)
* for eleanor: [latte](latte.html)

@ me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/calculush) if you want a shitty twine game too.
